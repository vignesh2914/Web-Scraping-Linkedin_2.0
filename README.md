# Latest updation On scraping 2-2-24

Kindly read the Note file below atlast

# updates 1 
Now the scraper fetch the data really cool  and fast. I have added a new feature to it, which is that you can now specify 
filteration process on jobs whether its last 24 hr or past week, or month etc 

# updates 2
Add on stuff like in this method scraping it hits error 429 which means the http request for that site  is blocked by server(too many request). to resolve that we added some condition like whenever the error hits it will be waiting for 60 seconds and again the data will be fetched  from web and stored in a csv file.

# updates 3
Saving as CSV file as been changed to automatically it will be saved into a new name  each time when we run our code. This is done by adding current date and time to filename so on

if ur using vs code add this extention edit csv for better view to data 

If u want u can compare the demo file with main file and u can look the diffrence in the code 

Still not over this project
