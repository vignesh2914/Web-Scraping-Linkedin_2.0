# updation On scraping 2-2-24

# updates 1.1
At this point, the scraper retrieves the data quickly .we added some new features likeÂ you can choose the filtering process on jobs based on the last 24 hours, the previous week, the previous month, etc. 


# updates 1.2
Add on like this: when using this way of scraping, it encounters error 429, which indicates that the server has stopped the http request for that website (too many requests). In order to fix that, we implemented various conditions, such as waiting 60 seconds after an error occurs before retrieving the data from the web and saving it in a CSV file.

# updates 1.3
Every time we execute our code, the saving as CSV file will now be done automatically and will have a new name. To accomplish this, update the filename with the current date and time.
